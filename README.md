# Voodoo Automation Framework

## About

Voodoo is a playwright based automation framework primarily used to showcase skill, but also a fun project I do on my free time using puns as functions.  

## Terminology (but really...they're  just puns)

Charms - Automation Actions

Dolls - Testing Context (i.e. website, products, etc)

Pins - Validators 

Hexes - Conditions 

Honestly I'm just winging it with the terminology :)
